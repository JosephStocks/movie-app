## The Movie Matrix 


## AWS <>


This is app allows the user to search for different movies and return a list of movies based of their input. There is also a list of prepopulated Top 100 movies based off genre that the user can scroll through. Each movie card will contain data on the front and then once clicked, data on the back. Once the user has registered an account and they are logged in they can then search or used the prepopulated lists to save the movie to a "Want to Watch List", "Seen List" or "Favorites List".

If the user decides they want to add this to any of their lists, they can hit either "Add to Watch List", "Add to Seen List", or "Add to Favorites".

Our base goal was to give the user the ability the register a username and password, login and choose a movie from the pre-populated lists so that they can add a chosen movie to a seen, favorites or watched list.
